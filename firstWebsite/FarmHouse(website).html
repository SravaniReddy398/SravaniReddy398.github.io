        <p>Fresh air, tall grass, and trees. These are a few of my favorite things. All are found on my aunt and uncle's farm. Along with farm animals, two huge barns, and a farm house. There are many things to see on this farm.
            First there is the landscape. The farm is sprawled across nine acres of open land. All that breaks up the view are a few scattered shade trees and fences. Everywhere you look you can see animals grazing on the most beautiful emerald grass imaginable. The edges of the farm are flanked by enormous pine trees that seem to touch the sky.
            Next are the farm animals. They range from the tiniest chicks to the burliest bulls, and everything in between. All day long you can see chickens pecking for food, cows lounging on the grass, horses grazing, and goats butting heads. Often times you will see the spotted donkeys following the horses in search of companionship. No matter where you look on the farm there is always an animal to watch.
            Finally there are the buildings: two barns and a quaint little farmhouse. The very first building you see while driving up the curvy driveway is the farmhouse. It's a small, cream colored house with a porch that spans the entire front side. On the two sides are rose gardens with roses of every color known to man. The roses are a stark contrast to the muted color of the house itself. Then when you reach the back of the house there is another porch. This one is equipped with two rocking chairs and a swing. Then there are the barns. One of them is filled with rolls of hay and farm equipment. The other barn holds a small apartment and stalls for the animals. It is also filled with large, blue barrels that hold the animals food. These are the buildings on the farm.
            Fresh air, tall grass, and trees. Gorgeous landscapes, animals, and buildings. My aunt and uncle's farm is full of these things.</p>
            <p>With the infrastructural growth in India, the vertical expansion of buildings is also somewhere causing asphyxiated state in terms of peace. Away from the hustle bustle of urban areas, people have started to invest in land in remote areas.</p>
            <p>A farmhouse is a type of a house, which serves a residential purpose in an agricultural setting. It is surrounded by a farm or a well landscaped garden. These can also be called as country houses, away from one's residential address, where one can go to spend some time in the lap of nature. The farmhouses are designed in varied manners from traditional to modern. But all have the rural or agricultural flavour.</p>
            <p>Farmhouses are spread in a modest to a huge chunk of land with large front porches. These days, we also find farmhouses planned and constructed with one or two stories. Over time, as the city of Nawabs got more built-up, farmhouses began to be seen as second homes and weekend getaways, where substantial open space was available.</p>
            <p>"The category of people quite visible in investing in a farmhouse is the ones who already have homes, and invest for the reason of having a second home or luxury purposes," says Satish Srivastava, MD, Nilansh Group. Adding further, he says, "Today, when people spend in buying a farmhouse, it is entirely as per their need and choice. Also, as buying land outside city can't be plotted, and since it's cheap, it is converted into a farm house by fencing the area and installing a gate to secure the land"</p>
            <p>There is a sudden rush or surge in investments on farm houses due to cramped surroundings of modern urban India. People prefer farmhouses to experience comfort in a second home, wherein they can also discover the joys of a country life.</p>
            <p>The areas covered under the belt of farmhouses in Lucknow as per Bhalla are Sitapur Road, Sultanpur Road, Rae Bareilly Road, Deva Road and Kanpur Road. It means, these areas are within the radius of 50 kilometers from Hazratganj area, which happens to be the central part of the city.</p>
            <p>With the changing trends and market dynamics of real estate sector, people believe in investing in areas that are cheaper in comparison to land available in urban areas.</p>
            <p>Talking about the price bracket, Bhalla, says, "The price range varies as per the areas. The prices on the main road are higher than the areas that fall in the interior of the main road. It ranges from Rs 300-600 per sq feet on the main roads like Sitapur and Rae Bareilly Road, whereas it is Rs 100-250 till 300 per sq feet in the interiors."</p>
            <p>Farmhouses are not just being used for residential purposes, but some owners today, are also using it for commercial purposes. Renting it out for wedding parties, corporate events, etc. is the current trend.</p>
            <p>Deepak Kumar, who owns a farmhouse on Deva road, avers, "I find myself a privileged one for having a farmhouse. Since, at times due to work load, it becomes difficult to take the family away from the city. So, on weekends, we come to our farmhouse, wherein the kids gather with their cousins, enjoy swimming, party hard and also enjoy the greenery all around. In fact, going to office from my farm house is only refreshing, as I feel more energized after a two day stay here."</p>
            <p>As an investment option, any day, a farmhouse has its intrinsic value intact and appreciation of value as lucrative as land within city, or marginally less. The owner has the luxury of part disposal of larger chunk of farm land. It gives the farm owner flexibility of retaining the essentials and disposing extra unused for better ROI (Return on Investment).</p>
            <p>But before investing in a farmhouse, one must look in for some valid points, so as to buy from the right hands in a secured fashion.</p>
            <p>As per Satish Srivastava, MD, Nilansh Group, "It's important to check if the land is fertile; the notation or the registry papers of the builder should be checked to know the land and builder's authentication."</p>
            <p>Srivastava adds that the township concept where there are many farmhouses is always better due to security reasons. One must check if the land has wall fencing, if there are wide roads near the land, availability of water and power, the distance of the farmhouse from one's home in the city should be enough for the farmhouse to be in a lush and peaceful area.</p>
            <p>"The land for a farmhouse should be acquired and approved by the government. Further, the area for a farmhouse should be at least 2000 sq feet or above," quips Robin Goyal, director, KG Constructions.</p>
            <p>Adding more, Goyal, shares, "Even areas like Faizabad Road and Mohan Lal Ganj are coming up with the farmhouse projects."</p>
            <p>These days, it is easier to set up a farmhouse than a second home within a city as land is cheaper outside rather than within the city. In this regard, Goyal added that due to the increasing land prices, people who can afford to buy land prefer these days to invest in a second home as it is another asset for them.</p>
            <p>Discover the delights of magnificent views, unwind and relax in absolute privacy, the sweet sounds and smells of nature. If you really want to immerse yourself in true outback life, think of buying a house with a farm!</p>
